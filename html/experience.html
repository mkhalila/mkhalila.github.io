	<h4>Adaptability</h4>
	<h4>Teamwork</h4>
	David Gelernter writes in his book, The Aesthetics of Computing, "we are a nation of Ferrari drivers tooling around with kinked fuel lines at fifteen miles per hour." - "the 'software crisis' is real". This quote inspired me to create a concept that won 3rd place at Wandsworth Dragons’ Den competition.  I lead a team which used the idea of a portable programming computer called “MyCPU (My Central Programming Unit)”. The idea behind this was inspired by the invention of the Raspberry Pi - to get more young people interested in programming. I developed leadership, co-operation and presentational skills whilst working with my team to analyse and design a solution.
	<br><br>
	We discussed bringing this idea into fruition; but based on feedback from the team we agreed against it. I learnt a key lesson from my team: a strong, practical, and innovative idea doesn’t always lead to a successful product.
	<h4>Effective Communication</h4>
	<h4>Self-motivation & Drive</h4>
	<h4>Initiative & Creative Problem Solving</h4>
