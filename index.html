	<h1>Hi, I'm Khalil</h1>
	I'm a software developer & a Computer Science student at King's College London.

	I have a keen interest in Software Engineering and programming, which has proven to be of an excellent standard based on my results. 
	<br><br>
	I have been developing full stack applications for 2 years in Java.  Across three software development based modules, I have had the opportunity to work with – and occasionally lead - a diverse group of programmers in developing a varying range of applications including a ‘OCEARCH’ inspired Shark tracker application, an animated board game called Oware, and a real-time macroeconomic indicator suite for assisting A-Level Economics students. These projects were collaborated using Git – which I have had over 2 years’ experience with.
