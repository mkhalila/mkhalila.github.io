	<h1>Hi, I'm Khalil</h1>
	I'm a software developer & a Computer Science student at King's College London.

	I have a keen interest in Software Engineering and programming, which has proven to be of an excellent standard based on my results. 
	<br><br>
	I have been developing full stack applications for 2 years in Java.  Across three software development based modules, I have had the opportunity to work with – and occasionally lead - a diverse group of programmers in developing a varying range of applications including a ‘OCEARCH’ inspired Shark tracker application, an animated board game called Oware, and a real-time macroeconomic indicator suite for assisting A-Level Economics students. These projects were collaborated using Git – which I have had over 2 years’ experience with. 
	<br><br>
	Nevertheless, I have also had months of experience writing programs in C++ - an example of which was a Sudoku solver. I am also experienced in writing function-based programs in Scala, which has inspired to me to look deeper into the functional programming paradigm. I started off programming with Pascal, which I continued with for 4 years. Using Pascal with Delphi I spent half a year analysing, designing, implementing, testing, and evaluating a student management system based on requirements provided by a real client. Moreover, I was also fortunate to be involved in a team of four, tackling the AI Planning problem of a garbage collecting robot using PDDL to define the domain and problem. The Database Systems module at King’s gave me the opportunity to build a Bagel Shop database system using MySQL over the course of two months.
