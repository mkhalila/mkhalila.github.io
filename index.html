			<h2>Hi, I'm Khalil</h2>
			I'm a Software Developer &amp; Computer Science student at King's College London.
			I have a keen interest in programming and software engineering, which has proven to be of an <strong>excellent standard</strong> based on my <a href="html/education.html">results</a>. 
			<br><br>
			I consider myself to be a <strong>dependable, charismatic team player</strong> and aspire to the highest standards in everything I do, including constant <strong>iterative improvement</strong> to the code I write. I thrive in my involvement as a team and <strong>enjoy learning</strong> new and challenging concepts. 
			<br><br>
			I believe my <strong>biggest achievement</strong> is that I have memorised almost a half of the Holy Qur'an. I think this demonstrated my ability to learn and do new and challenging things with <strong>perseverance and dedication.</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Skills</h2>
			I have been developing full stack applications for 2 years in Java.  Across three software development based modules, I have had the opportunity to work with – and occasionally lead - a diverse group of programmers in developing a varying range of applications including an ‘OCEARCH’ inspired <a href="html/projects.html">shark tracker application</a>, an animated board game called <a href="html/projects.html">Oware</a>, and <a href="html/projects.html">Ecru Economics</a> - a real-time macroeconomic indicator suite for assisting A-Level students. These projects were collaborated using Git – which I have had over 2 years’ experience with. 
			<br><br>
			Nevertheless, I have also had months of experience writing programs in C++ - an example of which was a <a href="html/projects.html">sudoku solver</a>. I am also experienced in writing function-based programs in Scala, which has inspired me to look deeper into the functional programming paradigm. I started off programming with Pascal, which I continued with for 4 years. Using Pascal with Delphi I spent half a year analysing, designing, implementing, testing and evaluating a <a href="html/projects.html">student management system</a> based on requirements provided by <strong>real clients</strong>. Moreover, I was also fortunate to be involved in a team of four, tackling the AI planning problem of a <a href="html/projects.html">garbage collecting robot</a> using PDDL to define the domain and problem. The Database Systems module at King’s gave me the opportunity to build a <a href="html/projects.html">bagel shop database system</a> using MySQL over the course of two months. 
			<br><br>
			More recently, using Ruby and the Rails framework; my team and I have developed <a href="html/projects.html">Modulect</a>: a module selection website for the Head of Technology Enhanced Learning at King's College London.

			<h2>Industry Year</h2>
			My studies have whetted my desire to want to do an industry year because I want to utilise the knowledge that I have acquired and the experiences that I have gained from developing software, and want to transfer these on an enterprise level. Software engineering has changed the way I reason and the way I approach problems. Studying Computer Science has taught me to question what lies at the core of the problem, and to develop a <strong>systematic approach</strong> to try to solve it rather than frustratingly giving up; something I thought I could never achieve before I started programming. 
			<br><br>
			Starting from this July, I look forward to spending 12 months as a Software Engineer as part of the <a href="html/experience.html">API Connect</a> team at <strong>IBM</strong>.
